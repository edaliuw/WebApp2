## Differences between WebApp1B and WebApp2

Minor change: A small name change since the last one wasn't good. Not saying this one is much better

**Serious Changes**
Basically, I realized that the schema structure for this applicaiton made no sense in trying to build out a tournament bracket. I needed to connect Brackets to Round to Matches to Players. In my effort to re-write most of the code from WebApp1B to WebApp2, I had to scrap most things from before and re-organize things. Basically, had I gone from design to code instead of Code First, I probably would've saved myself a ton of headaches.

Unfortunately, I ran out of time in making the app functional. Seed data and database initialization are basically busted and I'm confused how to fix this. *I was hoping you could give me some feedback in looking at what mistakes I've made here*.

## Future Goals

Fixing all the bugs from WebApp2, which when completed should result in a more robust application. Had I continue building upon WebApp1B, there probably would be no way of reaching the overall goal. Building a tournament maker that can assign seeds to participants and record data for "matches" or "games".
